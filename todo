# fix-issue-201

- [x] `SIGHUP` exit code if pipe failed.
	- [ ] Ask Lea if she remembers any situations when bash had exit code `143` (`SIGTERM`) or can it be fully replaced by `SIGHUP`?

- [ ] Does `kill(-getpid(), SIGTERM);` work in `raise_error_to_own_subprocess()`?

- [x] Fix `yes "no" | head -n 10`.

- [ ] Tester reported leaks for `ifconfig | grep ":"` and `ifconfig | grep nothing` on school computer.

- [x] Fix valfd Makefile goal.



# export:

- [x] If args_len < 2, print all exported env vars in ASCII order, with "export " prepended.
	- [x] The value gets put in double-quotes.
	- [ ] Quotes, dollar signs, backslash and '`' are escaped with a backslash.

- [x] If one of the variable assignments is not a valid variable name, return value will be GENERAL_ERROR (1), but export will still go through all arguments.
The error message gets printed for every invalid identifier.

- [x] If the argument string does not have an '=' and the key does not already exist, the value will be set to NULL.
- [x] If the key already exists, the env_node will be set to be exported.

### Error messages:
- bash: export: `<invalid name>': not a valid identifier

### Test cases:
- [x] export "" -> export: `': not a valid identifier
- [ ] export without any variable in env left -> just a newline.
