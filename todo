# wildcard expansion:

- [x] Get a list of all files of the current directoy.
- [x] Sort that list alphabetically.

- "." and ".." don't have to be filtered, bash also displays them.

- [ ] Only search files starting with "." if the first character of arg is also '.'.

- [ ] Test with files that have no permissions.
       If  the end of the directory stream is reached, NULL is returned and errno is not changed.  If
       an error occurs, NULL is returned and errno is  set  appropriately.   To  distinguish  end  of
       stream  from  an error, set errno to zero before calling readdir() and then check the value of
       errno if NULL is returned.
	- Filenames can still be read even of files that have no read permissions.

- Wildcard at first and last position have a high impact.
